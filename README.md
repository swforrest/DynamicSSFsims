# Temporal-step-selection-analyses

The code in this repository accompanies a paper titled 'Simulating animal movement trajectories from temporally dynamic step selection functions', which is due to be submitted soon.

In this paper we used harmonic terms to estimate temporally dynamic coefficients from step selection models, from which we simulated animal movement trajectories. We interacted the movement, habitat selection and memory parameters with the harmonic terms, resulting in temporal dynamism for all these processes.

The files are numbered by the order of analyses, and some output files that are used by the succeeding scripts.
