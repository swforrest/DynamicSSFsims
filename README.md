# Temporal-step-selection-analyses

Adding temporal dynamics to step selection analyses for the purpose of generating trajectories. I am applying harmonic terms (and how many to use), and testing several model fitting approaches, before generating temporally dynamic trajectories.

This is currently a work in progress and not yet published.

If you are interested in hearing more about the approaches or using the code, please contact me.
